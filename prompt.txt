Write a technical tutorial on how to use regular expressions (Regex) in Python. The document must be written in English, with a maximum length of 12 pages, and should include 3 to 4 practical and well-explained code examples.

Follow strictly the formatting and style defined in the file Python/Namespaces/Namespaces.tex, and use as reference the available commands listed in Python/Headers/Headers.tex.

Structure the content as follows:

Create a new directory called Regex inside the project.

Inside the Regex directory, create the main tutorial file in LaTeX format, named Regex.tex.

Place all code examples in separate files inside the subdirectory Regex/codes/, and include them properly in the main .tex file using \lstinputlisting.

Important technical restrictions (to avoid LaTeX compilation errors):

Do not use emojis (e.g., 😊, 🚀) or special symbols such as ✓, •, →, …, —, “”, ‘’, etc.

Avoid accented characters (á, é, ñ, etc.) and non-ASCII characters inside code blocks or filenames.

All files must be saved in UTF-8 encoding without BOM.

Use only safe ASCII characters in code (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and symbols such as (){}[]<>!@#%^&*-=_+:;"',./?|\~`).

The content must be clear, structured, and educational, aimed at readers with basic Python knowledge who want to effectively learn how to use Regex.
